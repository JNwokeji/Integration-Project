###I am not going to go up each level. I will start from various ages to give a taste of whats happening
###The next age I will start from is age 10
###to make it more smooth and easier to read I will break age sections by a list of diffrent integers
###I will also show off the diffrent loops I can code while doing this.
###the first break in age sections will be done useing a while loop that terminates after hitting int 10
ageBreak = 1
while ageBreak < 10:
    print(ageBreak)
    ageBreak += 1
